Mobx basics:
  Mobx has concept of stores. A store contains a subset of application state, its drivates
  actions, and reactions.
  State:
    This is the application state, Graph of object, arrays, primitives, references that
    forms the model of your application.
  Derivates: 
    It is any value that can be computed automativily from application state.
    Like total price of an order.
  Reactions:
    These are the operations (mostly I/O) that we want to happen on some state change. 
    Like fetching search results as user types in the search field 
  
(Note: We will be only covering state and derivates in this blog post)


(Code Example here)

@observable signal Mobx that these values can change over time.
@computed signle Mobx that it is a computation and can be derived from state.
